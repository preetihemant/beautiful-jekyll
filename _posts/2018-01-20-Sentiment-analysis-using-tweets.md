Sentiment analysis categorizes opinions of users on a given subject into three broad categories - positive, negative and neutral.
These opinions could be expressed through natural langauge or text. In this post, I will analyse emotion or sentiment of textual expressions put out on twitter.
<p> Twitter is a popular platform for people to voice their opinions and can be used for a fairly accurate assesment of public
sentiment on a subject. Twitter provides us with a public API to query their database and these results are the input for my task. </p>
