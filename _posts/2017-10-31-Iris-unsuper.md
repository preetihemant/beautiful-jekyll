<p> In unsupervised learning, samples are classified without the knowledge of their labels. K means clustering is a popular 
classification algorithm for unsupervised learning. Here, we group data into clusters of similar samples. Each cluster has a
centroid,the algorithm finds the nearest centroid for each data point and assign it to that cluster. The number of centroids or 
classes we want should be specified before the algorithm is run. We can employ the elbow method to find the optimal number of classes.
In case of the Iris data set we already know the number of claases which is 3 - Iris setosa, versicolor and virginica</p>

An exploratory analysis of the iris data can be found in my earlier post [Supervised Machine Learning - Iris data](posts/2017-10-29-iris-supervised.md).
