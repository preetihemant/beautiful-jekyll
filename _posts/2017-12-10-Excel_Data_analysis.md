Here is a link [MS Excel Data analysis](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhaxImlIA1PSbyNanFBy_GFdbN4) to different analysis and visualizations I have performed using only MS Excel 2016. It includes 
* Descriptive Statistics analysis
* Charts - Box plots, histograms, heirarchical charts, sparklines, pareto
* Trend Curves - Linear, exponential, power and moving average
and many others.
