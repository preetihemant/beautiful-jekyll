### 68-95-99.7_Rule
The rule gives a quick estimation of the distribution of data. Given a distribution with mean μ and std. deviation σ, 68% of the values lie within one standard deviation of the mean. 95% of the data within 2 standard deviations of the mean and 99.7% between 3 standard deviations of the mean.

* P(μ  - σ <= X <= μ  + σ) ~ 0.68
* P(μ - 2σ <= X <= μ + 2σ) ~ 0.95
* P(μ - 3σ <= X <= μ + 3σ) ~ 0.99

### 3_M's_quick_reference
How do the three measures of central tendency compare? Here is a list of factors and how they affect the mean, mode and median

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/preetihemant/Udacity/master/Descriptive_Statistics_Course/3M's.png "Central_measure_comparisons")

* Mean has a simple equation Mean = (Sum of all data values)/(No. of Data values)
* Median too can be described by an equation but it is not as simple as the average
  * For even n [ X <sub>n/2</sub> + X <sub>(n/2)+1</sub> ] / 2
  * For odd  n  X <sub>(n+1)/2</sub>
* Although median and mode are dependent on the data values, they are not severely affected by small changes. For instance both mode and     mean are unaffected by the addition of a single new value.
* If looking at a histogram to determine mode, then mode will take on different values depending on the bin size. The maximum value of mode   occuring when there is just one bin.
